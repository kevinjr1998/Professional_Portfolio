## The task

This project involved me creating a webpage that would contain information about me, some of the work I have completed so far (with regard to web development) and my contatc information. This also involved using the webpage to demonstate some of my experience with regards to CSS specifically. This involved using pseudoclasses to demonstate feedback to the user, smoothscrolling to sections in the webpage when a hyperlink is clicked, using css variables and implementing responsive design with regards to shifting the page layout when the viewport dimensions are changed.
